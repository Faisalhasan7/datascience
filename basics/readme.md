# Files

This section contains various files and resources I am working with while learning data science. It includes datasets, code samples, notes, and project files that support my studies and hands-on practice. Each file or folder is organized by topic or project, allowing easy access to the data and tools I'm currently exploring. Whether it's a dataset for analysis, a Jupyter Notebook with code, or notes on key concepts, these files document my progress and discoveries in data science.
